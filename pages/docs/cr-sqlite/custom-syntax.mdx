# Custom Syntax

A current eye-sore of CR-SQLite is the use of `SELECT` statements to invoke functions which do some sort of modification of the database schema. E.g., converting a table to a crdt requires running: `SELECT crsql_as_crr('table_name')`.

Another eye-sore is the requirement to wrap alterations of `crr`s with [crsql_begin_alter](/cr-sqlite/api-methods/crsql_begin_alter) and [crsql_commit_alter](/cr-sqlite/api-methods/crsql_commit_alter).

Luckily, we're partnering with the folks over at the [libsql](https://libsql.org/) project to add a dedicated syntax for CRR creation and modification. 

> Note: we're also converting `crsql_as_crr` to a virtual table to simplify syntax: https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite/issues/181

```sql
CREATE TABLE post (
 id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
 views COUNTER,
 content PERITEXT,
 owner_id LWW INTEGER
) AS CausalLengthSet;
```

The above defines a CRR where:

- The table is a CLSet ([causal length set](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3380787.3393678))
- Views is a COUNTER ([distributed counter](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/cs380p/papers/Counters.html))
- Content is PERITEXT ([collaborative text](https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/))
- owner_id is a LWW register

## Ongoing Syntax Proposal

## Table Syntax

Each table can be modeled as some sort of set CRDT. Grow only set, observe remove set, causal length set, etc.

Given that, we could add a modified `CREATE TABLE` that is `CREATE [set_type]`

Example:

```sql
CREATE [SetType] foo ( ... );
```

Other alternatives would be to keep `CREATE TABLE` and append some modifier to the end:

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo ( ... ) AS [SetType]; -- option 1
CREATE TABLE foo ( ... ) CRDT = [SetType]; -- option 2
```

Where `SetType = CausalLengthSet | GrowOnlySet | DeleteWinsSet | AddWinsSet`

> Note that, in practice, we may end up only supporting `CausalLengthSet` given that type can be used to model all of the other sets in user space.

## Column Syntax

Within a row, each column can be a specific type of CRDT. The type of CRDT chosen controls the semantics of how that given cell is merged.

Some options for a column:
1. Last Write Wins Register
2. Counter
3. Distributed Fractional Index*
4. Multi-Value Register
5. RGA
6. Peritext

One idea is to add an extra type (the crdt type) to the column type.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo (
  id PRIMARY KEY,
  views COUNTER,
  content PERITEXT,
  owner_id LWW INTEGER
) AS CausalLengthSet;
```

Or generally:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [table_name] (
  [col_name] [CRDTType] [Type],
  ...
) AS [SetType];
```

where `CRDTType = LWW | Counter | DistFractIndex | MVRegister | RGA | Peritext`

\* Distributed Fractional Index would need to be parameterized. I can go into more detail on this one after we talk through what has been proposed so far.
