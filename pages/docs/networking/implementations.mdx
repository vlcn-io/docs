# Implementations

While `cr-sqlite` is network agnostic, it is nice to be able to pick a networking layer and just start coding. Below is a list of complete networking layer implementations:

- A JavaScript [server for whole CRR sync](/js/networking)
- A JavaScript [client for whole CRR sync](/js/networking)

If you'd like to get started rolling your own, see the [example implementation of whole CRR sync](./whole-crr-sync).
